//! Watershed partitioning
//!   - the classic Recast partitioning
//!   - creates the nicest tessellation
//!   - usually slowest
//!   - partitions the heightfield into nice regions without holes or overlaps
//!   - the are some corner cases where this method creates produces holes and overlaps
//!      - holes may appear when a small obstacles is close to large open area (triangulation can handle this)
//!      - overlaps may occur if you have narrow spiral corridors (i.e stairs), this make triangulation to fail
//!   * generally the best choice if you precompute the navmesh, use this if you have large open areas
